This is a learning project on odin website to create a recipe website using all the knowledge I have acquired so far in the previous lessons.

This will be a website containing a few recipes and presumably a few pages and links with it. It won't have any styling as we haven't learned CSS yet but in the future I assume we will
be coming back to this project and updating it with some CSS styling.
