        <h2>Description</h2>

Here’s a recipe that combines the flavors and techniques of traditional Iraqi cuisine.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>1/2 cup finely chopped onion</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro (optional)</li>
            <li>2 eggs, beaten (for frying)</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine ground beef, chopped onion, garlic, cumin, coriander, turmeric, salt, and black pepper. Mix well with your hands or a spoon until just combined.
            </li>
            <li>Divide the meat mixture into 8-10 portions, depending on desired kebab size. Shape each portion into a ball and then flatten slightly into a disk shape.
            </li>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. When hot, add 2-3 kebabs to the skillet (do not overcrowd).
            </li>
            <li>Cook the kebabs for 4-5 minutes on each side, or until they are golden brown and crispy. Repeat with remaining kebabs.
            </li>
            <li>Alternatively, you can grill the kebabs over medium-high heat for 4-5 minutes per side, or until cooked through.
            </li>
            <li>Serve the kebabs hot with a sprinkle of parsley and cilantro (if using). Traditionally, Iraqi kebabs are served with a side of creamy hummus, garlic sauce (Toum), and pita bread.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p><h3>NOTE:</h3>If you prefer a crispy exterior, you can coat the kebabs with a mixture of flour, eggs, and breadcrumbs before frying. Simply dip each kebab in the beaten eggs, then coat with a mixture of 1/2 cup all-purpose flour, 1/4 cup breadcrumbs, and a pinch of salt. Fry the kebabs in hot oil (about 350°F) for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and crispy.</p>
